            <h2>Hi! I'm Kylo</h2>
            <p>
                <br> I am a 23-year-old individual on an 
                <br> exciting journey of self-discovery 
                <br> and personal growth. In this page, 
                <br> I will offer a glimpse into my life, 
                <br> aspirations, and the experiences that
                <br> have shaped the person I am today. 
                <br> I was born and raised in San Andres,
                <br> Manila, a place that holds the roots 
                <br> of my identity. Growing up in a crowded
                <br> but with discipline people and with a 
                <br> lovely family, I developed a deep 
                <br> appreciation for my family who has been
                <br> my support system and filled me with love, 
                <br> that have become the cornerstone of
                <br> my character. <br>


<br> Currently, I am a 2nd year college 
<br> student studying BS in Information 
<br> Technology at Rizal Technological
<br> University. Academic pursuits have
<br> always been a significant part of
<br> my life, and the pursuit of knowledge
<br> is a driving force that fuels my 
<br> personal and professional growth. 
<br> Courses such as Information Technology 
<br> have not only broadened my perspective
<br> but have also ignited a passion for 
<br> my computer skills and interests. <br>


<br> Beyond the academic realm, 
<br> I am an avid fan of Badminton, 
<br> because everytime I play I feel 
<br>relieved and that's one of my excercise 
<br> every weekends to strengthen my body. 
<br> Whether it's Sports related, or simply 
<br> about computers most of all hardwares,
<br> these pursuits to provide a balance to my 
<br> academic life and allow me to express my 
<br> creativity. This journey into myself is 
<br> an ongoing exploration of identity, purpose, 
<br> and the myriad experiences that make me who
<br> I am. Each day is an opportunity to learn,
<br> grow, and embrace the uniqueness that 
<br> defines my individuality. As I navigate the
<br> complexities of life, I am excited about the 
<br> adventures that lie ahead, confident in the 
<br> person I am becoming, and grateful for the 
<br> lessons that shape my story.
